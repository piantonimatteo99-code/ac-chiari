/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Users have full control over their own profile document, but no access to other users' data. It establishes a foundation for role-based access control by associating users with categories, but primarily focuses on securing individual user data.
 *
 * Data Structure: The data is organized into two top-level collections: `/users` and `/categories`.
 * - /users/{userId}: Contains private user profile information. Access is locked down to the owner of the document.
 * - /categories/{categoryId}: Contains public reference data that describes different user categories. This data is readable by anyone but not writable by clients.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Isolation: A user can only create, read, update, or delete their own document within the `/users` collection.
 * - No User Enumeration: Listing the entire `/users` collection is explicitly disallowed to protect user privacy and prevent data scraping.
 * - Read-Only Reference Data: The `/categories` collection is publicly readable to allow clients to fetch category information, but it is immutable from the client-side to ensure data integrity. It is assumed this data is managed by a trusted backend or seeded directly.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `User` document is designed for authorization independence. It includes a `categoryId` to avoid costly `get()` calls to other collections in more advanced scenarios.
 * - Relational integrity is maintained by ensuring the `id` field within a user's document always matches the document's ID in the path (`userId`). This link is enforced on creation and made immutable on update.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - User data (`/users`) and category metadata (`/categories`) are kept in separate top-level collections. This provides clear and secure access boundaries, allowing public read access to categories without exposing any user data.
